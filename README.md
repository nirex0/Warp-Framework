# Warp-Framework (WIP)
"A framework to create powerful and rich GUI C++ applications using DirectX API"

Yes I know what I've written, and Yes I know that this is not what it's said to be yet, but that's what the (WIP) tag is there for, is it not?

Anyhow, here's a list of what I aim to do with this framework.

DOCUMENTATION
=============

Sadly there's no doc available yet, I mean the framework needs to be 100% completed then I can start working on the doc, right? RIGHT?

License
=======

For now there's no license file available to tell you what you can or can't do with this project.

So for now, feel free to use it for any reason you want, and remember that there is absolutely no warranty!

But keep in mind that when this goes to production stage I probably will write a custom license for it.
