# Warp-Framework (WIP)
"A framework to create powerful and rich GUI C++ Single-Window applications using DirectX API"

Yes I know what I've written, and Yes I know that this is not what it's said to be yet, but that's what the (WIP) tag is there for, is it not?

Anyhow, here's a list of what I aim to do with this framework.
